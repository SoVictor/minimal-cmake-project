# Minimal CMake Project

A (somewhat) minimal C++ project that uses CMake for building.

Serves mainly as a sample for my students.

## Building

Use CMake and any compiler to build the project. No additional input is required.

## Running

Run demo.exe (or just "demo", if you are not using Windows) to test the project. You should see something similar to

```
A constructed
B constructed
B destructed
A destructed
```
